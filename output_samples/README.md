# output samples

The following are the output samples of our model, the first six pictures showed the image caption results of our model, for each image, we get three sentences to describe it, so that we can calculate the mean of the image caption embedded vectors, and substract the style for generating stories.

The next six pictures are the stories generated from the image captions.
